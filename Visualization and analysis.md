# **Visual Representation of Findings**

## **Daily Active Minutes**



During the week, Saturdays are the most active day, with an average total of 244.2 minutes of activity, whether it is very, fairly, or lightly active minutes.
Sunday is the less active day, with an average total of 208.5 minutes. Also, the biggest portion of activities made during any day of the week are light, with an average time variation between 174 and 207.1 minutes.
Average very active minutes vary between 19.4 and 23.1 minutes. The type of intensity with the least number of minutes per day is light, with an average varying between 12 and 15.2 minutes.


## **Activity Intensity vs. Burned Calories**


For every user, the average number of calories burned is given. The minutes of activity and their intensity are also correlated with the calories burned. As shown by the scatter plots, the more intense the activity, 
the more calories are burned. This proves that the average number of very active minutes and the average number of calories burned are strongly correlated, whereas the fairly and lightly active minutes are not very reflective
of the calories burned.


## **Logging Trends**


There are 33 users who log their activity data. From April 12 to May 12, the log activity for their activities decreased in a very slow manner, from 33 users to 21. This means that with time, fewer and fewer users commit to logging.
There are 24 users who log their sleep data. From April 12 to May 12, the log activity for their sleep varies a lot, with a maximum number of logs of only 17. Throughout the whole data recording, it never occurred that the 
24 users all log their sleep on the same day. Only 8 out of 24 people logged their sleep on May 12th.


## **Steps During the Week**


Sunday is the only day of the week with an average number of steps less than 7,000. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, the average number of steps taken by the users exceeds 8,000.


## **Steps vs. Calories Burned**

For every user, their average daily steps taken and their calories burned are monitored. The trendline in the above scatter plot shows a clear positive and strong correlation between the steps taken and 
the calories burned. The more steps are taken, the more the user burns calories.


## **Time Asleep vs. Time Awake**

After removing two outliers from the data, a clear relationship can be seen between the average time spent asleep and the average time spent awake in bed: the longer users sleep, the more time awake they will experience 
throughout their sleep cycles.


## **Sleep per Day**

Sunday is the day when users spend the most time asleep, with an average of 7.55 hours per user. On Thursdays, users spend the least time asleep, with an average of 6.71 hours per user.
